The icon you see in SkyClient's main menu and other places\nis made by none other than the esteemed Zetvue#9664.
Most of SkyClient's staff have not touched Hypixel Skyblock for several months. Quit today!
Grass is a plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. [...]\nGrasses are monocotyledon, herbaceous plants.
